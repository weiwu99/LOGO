### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: None, but program/command files can be saved/loaded

Features implemented: All specified Darwin Simulation, L-System, and LogoIDE features



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: Our FileReader for program/command input minimized assumptions we made about user input.
We also have a main splash menu so users can easily move between programs without touching the underlying code.

Known Bugs: There are a couple edge cases for each program that were not handled, but for the most part the programs run
well


### Impressions
The project was a lot of fun but our group certainly felt pressed for time at the end despite working on it consistently
over the period given. In the end we were left with a functioning program that works very well and makes it easy for the
user to navigate between features.
